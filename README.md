# molecular-descriptors

Some code relevant to computing descriptors for calculated molecular orbitals, including:
    - Orbital Moment of Inertia
    - Percentage Orbital Weighting on Heteroatom
    - Radial Distribution Function

As well as distance functions computing the distance between two molecules based on the above descriptors.

And Simple k-NN regression with sklearn.
